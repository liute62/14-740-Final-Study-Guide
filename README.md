## Network Measurement

### purposes of network measurement
1. short-term
   * Detect hot-spots in network (congested linkes, overload routers)
   * Detecting attacks (DoS, worm propagation)
2. long-term
   * Traffic engineering (If many bits from Yahoo are observed, maybe negotiate a peering relationship)
   * Re-routing traffic (Change IGP metrics)
   * Upgrade links (e.g. from OC-48 to OC-192)
3. Others
   * Accounting
   * Research
### uses of basic measurement tools
+ packet traces
   * Raw data: header + data payload
+ SNMP counters
   * Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   * Simplistic view: asking router for info
   * Router has counters on link traffic: 1) Byte counts 2) Packet counts
   * Usages: 1) billing 2) graphing
   * Limitations: can't figure out 1) Types of traffic (Web, P2P, TCP) 2) Source of the traffic 3) Destination
+ ping
   * 
+ traceroute
   * 

### netflow tools vs measurement tools
+ flow definition

+ flow record

+ sampling methods

+ flow aggregation

### pick the most appropriate measurement tool



## Congestion Control The Routerâ€™s View

### packet scheduling algorithms vs drop policies
+ Packet scheduling: ordering of transmission
   * FIFO
   * Priority Queuing: Routers use one queue for each priority (multiple queues in total)
   * Round Robin Queuing: Separate queue for each flow, if a flow send too fast, its own queue will fill up
   * Fair Queuing: Desired Bit-by-Bit round robin, but can't send a bit at a time : calculate transmission finishing time for each packet
+ Drop policy: which packet gets discarded
   * FIFO: drop tail
   * Priority Queuing: drop lowest priority first
   * Round Robin Queuing: Separate drop policy could be implemented
### algorithm and issues
+ FIFO
   * Doesn't discriminate
   * Relies on end-hosts to implement congestion control
+ Priority Queueing
   * High priority will starve low priority
+ Round Robin Queueing
   * A flower with bigger packets will get more bandwidth in a packet-by-packet round-robin router
+ Fair Queuing
   * **Work conserving** Link is never left idle
   * **max-min fairness** Maximizes the min data rate of any flow, no starvation of any flow
+ Weighted Fair Queueing
   * Assign a weight(priority) to each queue
   
### opportunities for a router to do congestion control
+ TCP needs to create loss to discover available bandwidth
+ Rounter knows congestion state and could signal end-hosts:
  * Randomly Early Drop(RED) gateways
  
### goals, details and advantages of the RED Gateway algorithm
#### Detail
+ Router-centric congestion control
  * still leverages TCP end-hosts
  * Active Queue Management (AQM) scheme
+ Decide which connection to nofity of congestion
  * **Randomly** chooses a packet ...
  * ... before buffer overflow, thus **early**
  * Chosen packet is **dropped** to inform sender
#### Goals
 + Reduce persistent queuing delay
 + Reduce unnecessary packet drops in some cases
#### Design
 + Avoid **global synchronization**
     * don't want all connections to back off and increase at the same time
 + Avoid bias against **bursty traffic** which otherwise uses low bandwidth
     * don't want to drop packets mostly from busty connections
#### Advantages
RED keep the router from Drop Tail regime
Problems about Drop Tail:
+ Biased against bursty connection
+ Global synchronization
#### issues
+ Probability of particular flow's packets being dropped is roughly proportional to the share of bandwidth
+ Can identify bad flows, but additional mechanisms on top of RED needed to deal with them (UDP)

#### Algorithm
1) avg < MINth add packet
2) MAXth <= avg drop the arriving packet
3) MINth <= avg < MAXth
   calculate probability Pa
   rand() < Pa ? if so: mark the arriving packet
Queue Length: 
* avg <- (1-B) * avg + B * q_length
Calculate Probability:
* pb <- MAXp * (Avg - MINth) / (MAXth - MINth) (nornamlly MAXp = 2%)
* pa <- pb / (1 - count * pb) count is the number of packets not dropped while Avg has been medium
* pa is the actual drop probability
